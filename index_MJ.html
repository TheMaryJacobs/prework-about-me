      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello there - I'm Mary. I mostly identify as a graphic designer. In the last year I've been self-employed, completing a wide variety of creative projects for small businesses in the Twin Cities. My background is in camp counseling and food marketing. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>San Diego, CA >>> Edina, MN >>> Ames, IA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p> Camping, craft projects, sailing, cooking, and as of this summer, golfing. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Designing beautiful products across digital and physical platforms for clients that I believe in.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>St. Louis Park, MN</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I am a creator, a planner, and a problem solver. Learning the hard skills and languages of coding will give me an understanding of the ever-expanding capabilities web development holds, and in turn, make me a better designer, producer, and thinker.  A new shiny job would be neat too. </p>
