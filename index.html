      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi I'm Mary. I am a graphic designer. I worked in marketing for 3 years in the food industry, and now I am on my own doing contract work and freelance projects from print design, to chalkboard art to web design.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Edina, MN</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p> Camping, craft projects, sailing, cooking, and as of summer 2019 - golfing. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Designing beautiful projects across many platforms for clients that I believe in.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I am a creator, a planner, and a problem solver. Learning the hard skills and languages of coding will give me an understanding of the ever-expanding capabilities web development holds, and in turn, make me a better designer, producer, and thinker.  A new shiny job would be neat too. </p>
